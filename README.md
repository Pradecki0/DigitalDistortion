# DigitalDistortion
DSP Distortion VST Plug-in Program 

Created a working digital signal processing (DSP) distortion VST3 plugin program with a custom user
interface by using C++,  WDL-OL IPlug Framework, VST3 SDK, ASIO SDK, Xcode (Audio Tools for Xcode), and Photoshop.

The plug-in program creates an overdriven effect so that when a user turns the knob clockwise,
the digital audio signal will start to distort by clipping.

The plug-in program can be used in any digital audio workstation that supports VST3.
